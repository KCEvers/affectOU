# Plot autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions

Visualise the empirical and theoretical autocorrelation functions (ACF)
and cross-correlation functions (CCF) of an OU affect simulation. The
ACF is plotted for each dimension (diagonal panels), while the CCF is
plotted for each pair of dimensions (off-diagonal panels). The empirical
ACF/CCF is computed from the simulation data, while the theoretical
ACF/CCF is derived from the model parameters.

## Usage

``` r
ou_plot_acf(
  x,
  lag.max = 10,
  which_dim = NULL,
  which_sim = 1,
  share_yaxis = FALSE,
  palette = "Temps",
  alpha = 1,
  col_theory = "grey30",
  main = ifelse(x[["model"]][["ndim"]] == 1, "Autocorrelation Function",
    "Autocorrelation and Cross-correlation Functions"),
  sub = paste("Dimension", if (is.null(which_dim)) {
    
    seq.int(x[["model"]][["ndim"]])
 } else {
     which_dim
 }),
  xlab = "Lag (time)",
  ylab = ifelse(x[["model"]][["ndim"]] == 1, "ACF", "ACF / CCF"),
  legend_position = "topright",
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  A `simulate_affectOU` model object produced by
  [`simulate.affectOU()`](https://kcevers.github.io/affectOU/reference/simulate.affectOU.md)

- lag.max:

  Maximum lag to compute. Specified in terms of saved time points. For
  example, `lag.max = 10` corresponds to 10 time units and 100 lags with
  `save_at = 0.1`.

- which_dim:

  Dimension indices to plot (NULL for all)

- which_sim:

  Simulation index to plot (default 1). Only one simulation can be
  plotted at a time.

- share_yaxis:

  Logical; use same y-axis limits for all panels?

- palette:

  Color palette. Should be one
  [`grDevices::hcl.pals()`](https://rdrr.io/r/grDevices/palettes.html).

- alpha:

  Alpha transparency for colors (0 = transparent, 1 = opaque)

- col_theory:

  Color for theoretical ACF/CCF line

- main:

  Main title

- sub:

  Subtitle for panels

- xlab:

  X-axis label

- ylab:

  Y-axis label

- legend_position:

  Position of legend (one of `"bottomright"`, `"bottom"`,
  `"bottomleft"`, `"left"`, `"topleft"`, `"top"`, `"topright"`,
  `"right"`, `"center"`)

- ...:

  Additional graphical parameters

## Value

NULL (invisibly)

## Theoretical ACF

For the univariate OU process, the autocorrelation at lag \\\tau\\ is:
\$\$\rho(\tau) = e^{-\theta \tau}\$\$

The ACF decays exponentially at rate \\\theta\\—the same rate governing
perturbation decay toward the attractor. At lag equal to the half-life
(\\\log(2)/\theta\\), the ACF equals 0.5. Faster decay means less
predictability over time.

For multivariate processes, diagonal panels show the ACF for each
dimension, while off-diagonal panels show the cross-correlation function
(CCF) between dimension pairs, which can be non-zero even at lag 0 when
dimensions are correlated at equilibrium.

## Examples

``` r
model <- affectOU(ndim = 2)
sim <- simulate(model, nsim = 3)
ou_plot_acf(sim)


# ACF at half-life equals 0.5
model <- affectOU(theta = 0.5, mu = 0, gamma = 1)
sim <- simulate(model, stop = 500, dt = 0.01, save_at = 0.01)
ou_plot_acf(sim, lag.max = 5)
abline(v = log(2) / 0.5, col = "red", lty = 2) # half-life
abline(h = 0.5, col = "red", lty = 2)
```
