# Compute relaxation time

Generic function to compute relaxation time for a model. The relaxation
time \\\tau\\ is the time constant of exponential decay: the time for
the expected deviation from equilibrium to shrink to \\1/e \approx
36.8\\\\ of its initial value.

## Usage

``` r
relaxation(object, ...)
```

## Arguments

- object:

  A model object
