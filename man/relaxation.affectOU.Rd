\usage{
\method{relaxation}{affectOU}(
  object,
  which_dim = NULL,
  method = c("auto", "analytic", "numeric"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An \code{affectOU} model object.}

\item{which_dim}{Dimension index or indices to compute relaxation time for.
Default is \code{NULL}, which computes it for all dimensions.}

\item{method}{Method to compute relaxation time: \code{"analytic"} (uses
\eqn{1/\theta_{ii}}, only valid for diagonal theta), \code{"numeric"} (finds
root of \eqn{\mathrm{ACF} - 1/e}), or \code{"auto"} (uses analytic if theta
is diagonal, otherwise numeric).  Default is \code{"auto"}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (unused).}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{relaxation_affectOU}.

If a single dimension is requested, a list with:
\item{relaxation_time}{The relaxation time \eqn{\tau} (\code{NA} if dimension
is not stable)}
\item{half_life}{The half-life \eqn{t_{1/2}} (\code{NA} if dimension is not
stable)}
\item{dimension}{The dimension index}
\item{method}{Method used (\code{"analytic"}, \code{"numeric"}, or \code{NA})}
\item{theta_ii}{Diagonal element of theta for this dimension}
\item{ndim}{Dimensionality of the process}

If multiple dimensions are requested, a data frame with columns:
\code{dimension}, \code{relaxation_time}, \code{half_life}, \code{theta_ii}, \code{method}, \code{ndim}.
}
\description{
The relaxation time \eqn{\tau = 1/\theta_{ii}} is the characteristic time
scale of an OU process.  It measures how quickly the process "forgets" its
current state and returns toward equilibrium. The half-life
\eqn{t_{1/2} = \ln 2 \cdot \tau} is reported alongside. Relaxation time is only defined for stable dimensions
(\eqn{\theta_{ii} > 0}). Dimensions with \eqn{\theta_{ii} \le 0}
(random walk or unstable node) return \code{NA}.
}
\section{Exponential decay}{

Starting from \eqn{x_0}, the expected trajectory of the 1D OU process is:
\deqn{E[X(t)] = \mu + (x_0 - \mu)\,e^{-\theta t}}
The deviation from baseline decays exponentially.  The relaxation time is
the point at which the fraction \eqn{1/e \approx 36.8\%} of the initial
deviation remains:
\deqn{\tau = \frac{1}{\theta}}
The half-life is the point at which 50\\% remains:
\deqn{t_{1/2} = \ln 2 \cdot \tau = \frac{\ln 2}{\theta}
  \approx \frac{0.693}{\theta}}
}

\section{Multivariate relaxation time}{

For diagonal \eqn{\Theta} (uncoupled dimensions), each dimension has its
own analytic relaxation time \eqn{1/\theta_{ii}}.

For non-diagonal \eqn{\Theta} (coupled dimensions), cross-regulation
alters the effective relaxation rate. The relaxation time is then computed
numerically by finding when the theoretical autocorrelation function
crosses \eqn{1/e} (and \eqn{0.5} for the half-life). Coupling can either
speed up or slow down relaxation compared to the uncoupled case.
}

\section{Role of the diffusion parameter}{

For uncoupled systems (diagonal \eqn{\Theta}), \eqn{\gamma} affects only the \emph{amplitude} of
fluctuations (the stationary variance), not the relaxation time scale.
In the ACF \eqn{e^{-\theta_{ii}\tau}}, the stationary variance cancels.

For coupled systems, \eqn{\gamma} does influence the relaxation time
because the stationary covariance \eqn{\Sigma_\infty} (which depends on
\eqn{\Sigma}) enters the matrix-exponential ACF and no longer cancels.
