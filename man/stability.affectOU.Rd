\description{
Classify the dynamics and stability of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model
based on eigenvalue analysis of the drift matrix \eqn{\Theta}.
}
\details{
Note that although typically, a system is stable if all its eigenvalues have negative real parts, due to the parameterization of the OU process, stability is determined by \emph{positive} real parts:

\deqn{dX(t) = \Theta(\mu - X(t))dt + \Gamma dW(t)}

As \eqn{\Theta} is multiplied by the negative of the state variable, positive eigenvalues indicate that deviations from the attractor decay over time, leading to a stable system. Conversely, negative eigenvalues indicate that deviations grow over time, leading to an unstable system.
}
\section{Stability via eigenvalues}{

A stationary distribution exists if and only if all eigenvalues of
\eqn{\Theta} have positive real parts. This is a system-level
property, not a per-dimension property:

\enumerate{
\item Positive diagonal elements (\eqn{\Theta_{ii} > 0}) alone do
not guarantee stability. Strong off-diagonal coupling can push
eigenvalues toward zero or negative real parts, destabilising the system.
\item Conversely, coupling from other dimensions can stabilise a dimension
whose diagonal element is small or even zero. A dimension that would be
non-stationary in isolation may become stationary when embedded in a
coupled system.
}
}

\section{Oscillatory dynamics}{

Complex eigenvalues (arising from asymmetric coupling) produce oscillatory
dynamics, where dimensions cycle around each other. When all eigenvalues
have positive real parts, these oscillations are damped and the system still
converges to \eqn{\mu}. When any eigenvalue has a non-positive real part,
the oscillations grow and the system diverges.
}

\section{Terminology}{

System-level dynamics are classified using dynamical systems terms: a
node converges or diverges without oscillation, a spiral exhibits
damped or growing oscillations, and a saddle point has mixed
convergence/divergence across directions. Per-dimension dynamics describe
the behavior of each dimension in isolation based on its diagonal element
in \eqn{\Theta} ("stable node" if positive, "random walk" if zero,
"unstable node" if negative). A dimension classified as "stable node" in
isolation may still belong to an unstable coupled system due to
cross-regulation.
