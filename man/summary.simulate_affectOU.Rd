\title{Summarize simulation results}
\usage{
\method{summary}{simulate_affectOU}(object, burnin = 0, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{simulate_affectOU} object}

\item{burnin}{Time to exclude from the start of simulations (in time units,
not time points). Useful for allowing the process to reach stationarity.
Default is 0.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (unused)}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{summary_simulate_affectOU} containing:
\describe{
\item{ndim}{Number of dimensions}
\item{nsim}{Number of simulations}
\item{n_timepoints}{Number of time points used (after burnin)}
\item{burnin}{Burnin time excluded}
\item{dt}{Simulation time step}
\item{stop}{Total simulation time}
\item{save_at}{Time interval at which data was saved}
\item{seed}{Random seed used (or NULL)}
\item{statistics}{List with summary statistics of simulated data:
\describe{
\item{mean}{Mean for each dimension}
\item{sd}{Standard deviation for each dimension}
\item{cov}{Covariance matrix (NULL for 1D)}
\item{cor}{Correlation matrix (NULL for 1D)}
}
}
\item{theoretical}{List with theoretical stationary quantities (NULL if
model is not stationary):
\describe{
\item{mean}{Stationary mean for each dimension}
\item{sd}{Stationary standard deviation for each dimension}
\item{cov}{Stationary covariance matrix (NULL for 1D)}
\item{cor}{Stationary correlation matrix (NULL for 1D)}
}
}
}
}
\description{
Computes summary statistics of simulated data, pooled across all
simulations. Optionally compares to theoretical stationary distribution
when the model is stationary.

# 1D stationary model
model <- affectOU(theta = 0.5, mu = 0, gamma = 1)

# With burnin to exclude initial transient
